# Overview
Trawler is a tool for collecting, curating and cataloguing metadata - data about
data.  This allows teams (or individuals) to assemble knowledge about where
different pieces of data live, what they look like (schemas and metrics) and how
they are processed to produce derived data products, machine learning models and
dashboards.

Collected metadata can be used for a number of different purposes, including:
- Data discovery
- Data quality monitoring and alerting
- Change control
- Debugging data pipelines
- Data integration
